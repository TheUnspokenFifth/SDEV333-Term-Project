 * elements are unordered, order of keys does not matter. In this
 * MathSet API, we require items to be Comparable so we can maintain
 * them in order. By keeping items in order, we can guarantee
 * some reasonable performance for the set operations (union,
 * intersection, difference, symmetric difference) and for search
 * (contains).
